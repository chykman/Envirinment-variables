# Environment-variables

## I learned the distinction between infrastructure environments and environment variables, and how they are used in software development to manage different stages of the application lifecycle. Infrastructure environments refer to the various settings—like development, testing, and production—where applications are built, tested, and deployed, each serving a unique purpose. Environment variables, on the other hand, are dynamic values (e.g., database URLs, usernames, and passwords) that change based on the environment, allowing scripts to adapt without hardcoding. For a FinTech product across two AWS accounts, I explored how to configure these variables for local development (e.g., DB_URL=localhost), testing (DB_URL=testing-db.example.com), and production (DB_URL=production-db.example.com), ensuring safe experimentation, controlled testing, and secure live deployment. This foundational understanding helps in managing cloud infrastructure more effectively using shell scripts.
